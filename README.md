#Fortune Teller Project

##Description
This project will return a simple randomly generated fortune with a click ofo a button.

##Features
I don't think there are really any features here you just click a button and your fortune shows up.

##How to Use
You open the file in your browser then you click a button; I'm not certain how to make the fortune change with every click so you have to refresh the page if you want a new fortune. Also your device has to have access to JavaScript.

##Technologies
I used html css and js in this project and created it through Visual Studios Coding application.

##Collaborators
The collaborators on this project were me, myself and I.

##Lisence
I don't know what a lisence means but this program is a practice project just for entertainment and coding practice.
